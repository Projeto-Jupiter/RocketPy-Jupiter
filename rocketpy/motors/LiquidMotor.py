        Parameters
        ----------
        thrustSource : int, float, callable, string, array
            Motor's thrust curve. Can be given as an int or float, in which
            case the thrust will be considered constant in time. It can
            also be given as a callable function, whose argument is time in
            seconds and returns the thrust supplied by the motor in the
            instant. If a string is given, it must point to a .csv or .eng file.
            The .csv file shall contain no headers and the first column must
            specify time in seconds, while the second column specifies thrust.
            Arrays may also be specified, following rules set by the class
            Function. See help(Function). Thrust units are Newtons.
        burnOut : int, float
            Motor burn out time in seconds.
        nozzleRadius : int, float, optional
            Motor's nozzle outlet radius in meters. Its value does not impact
            trajectory simulation.
        throatRadius : int, float, optional
            Motor's nozzle throat radius in meters. Its value has very low
            impact in trajectory simulation, only useful to analyze
            dynamic instabilities, therefore it is optional.
        reshapeThrustCurve : boolean, tuple, optional
            If False, the original thrust curve supplied is not altered. If a
            tuple is given, whose first parameter is a new burn out time and
            whose second parameter is a new total impulse in Ns, the thrust
            curve is reshaped to match the new specifications. May be useful
            for motors whose thrust curve shape is expected to remain similar
            in case the impulse and burn time varies slightly. Default is
            False.
        interpolationMethod : string, optional
            Method of interpolation to be used in case thrust curve is given
            by data set in .csv or .eng, or as an array. Options are 'spline'
            'akima' and 'linear'. Default is "linear".
